* INSTALLATION *
Installation is pretty standard.  The following should suffice for most
users (typed into the command-line):

% ./configure
% make
% make install

For a more in-depth guide to installing GNU sources, please read the
INSTALL file contained within this folder.

We also have an installation article on our Wiki (go to the website listed
at the top of this file).

* BUGS *
I would REALLY appreciate if any bugs encountered could be described to
me at the bombz website (URL should be on the first line of this file).
